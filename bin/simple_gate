# Use ~/.servers.connections.yml and ~/.servers.yml to find the fastest path
# from the local server to a target server, establish a series of gateways
# and then execute a command on the remote server.
# Example of a ~/.servers.connections.yml file:
#
#   --- 
#   local: 
#   - foo
#   foo: 
#   - bar
#   - baz
#   bar: 
#   - foobar
#   - foobaz
#   - barbaz
#
# The only 'special' node is local, which is the starting point for all
# connections and not a real connection. All names are servers described in
# ~/.servers.yml
